## 10/3/2025 - Came up with an idea.  

Came up with the idea of a stream deck I started to research all the materials and how much it would be. found these SSD1306 0.42 OLED online. I brainstormed how many keys I would need I will try and get 12 keys with background images and a custom 3d printed case. ![st.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU3LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--016ccff21dab847e323b9f483d74a911c24b7c7b/st.jpg)

I watched a lot of tutorials and a lot of peoples stream deck projects. I also had no clue how to make my own pcb. After some videos I started to experiment. I also found what parts Im going to use and got it under 50 dollars. I still need help designing a pcb but im working on it. Core Electronics
1× Raspberry Pi Pico (or Pico W)
8× 0.96" SPI OLED displays
1× 74HC595 shift register
Buttons
8× Kailh Choc low-profile switches
Connectors
1× USB-C connector
Pin headers (for displays or Pico, if needed)
Passive Components
8× 0.1 µF capacitors (decoupling)
PCB and Hardware
1× custom PCB (120 mm × 70 mm)
4× M2.5 screws
4× M2.5 standoffs![Screenshot 2025-10-04 at 4.13.45 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDEzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--d6f6be87e61f34ff4e00d949da608d2724663fec/Screenshot%202025-10-04%20at%204.13.45%E2%80%AFPM.png)
