## 10/3/2025 - Came up with an idea.  

Came up with the idea of a stream deck I started to research all the materials and how much it would be. found these SSD1306 0.42 OLED online. I brainstormed how many keys I would need I will try and get 12 keys with background images and a custom 3d printed case. ![st.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU3LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--016ccff21dab847e323b9f483d74a911c24b7c7b/st.jpg)
